 Information Security Policy & Risk Assessment

This is a small personal project I created to explore how information security documentation works in real organizations.  
I wanted to understand how ISO 27001 and risk management are applied in practice — things like policies, internal audits, and incident response planning.

The project is based on a fictional company I called "SecureNet Ltd", which provides IT services and needs to protect its customer data and internal systems.  
I tried to simulate what a basic internal security framework might look like.

 Project Overview

The project includes three main parts:

1. Information_Security_Policy.pdf
   A short policy document that outlines how SecureNet Ltd manages access control, data protection, and incident reporting.  
   I wrote it based on common ISO 27001 principles but kept it simple and easy to understand.

2. Risk_Assessment_Report.pdf  
   A small risk register identifying key threats like phishing, data leaks, and downtime.  
   Each risk includes its impact, likelihood, and possible mitigation controls.

3. Incident_Response_Plan.pdf
   A step-by-step plan describing how the company should respond to a cybersecurity incident — from detection to recovery.

 What I Learned

Working on this helped me:
- Understand the structure and purpose of security policies and how they align with ISO 27001.
- Learn how to think like an auditor when identifying risks and writing mitigation strategies.
- Improve my documentation and report-writing skills — which are just as important as technical ones in cybersecurity.

 Next Steps

I’m planning to expand this by:
- Adding a visual workflow diagram for the incident response process.  
- Writing a short script to automatically generate a risk table from a CSV (to practice some Python).  
- Learning more about GDPR compliance and adding it to the policy.
